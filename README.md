# My Ubuntu Configuration

This repository contains my personal configuration files for various tools on Ubuntu. Feel free to explore and use any configurations that you find useful.

## Contents

- **vim**: Configuration file for the Vim text editor.
- **zshrc**: Configuration file for the Zsh shell.
- **starship.toml**: Configuration file for the Starship prompt.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiperman/my-ubuntu-wsl-conf.git
   ```

2. Explore the configuration files(`vim`, `zsh`, etc.).

3. Copy the desired configuration files to your home directory or adapt them based on your preferences.

4. For me, I use hard links to link the files from this repository to the system's configuration files.
